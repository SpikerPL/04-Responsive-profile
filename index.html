      <h1>Hello, my name is Patryk Piotrowicz!</h1>
      <img src="image.jpg" alt="Profile Image">
      <h2 class="text-center">Aspiring junior frontend developer!</h2>
      <p>Currently rocking the HTML, CSS, and the basics of Javascript, Patryk has embarked on a love affair with Ruby at a bootcamp. Rumour has it that Ruby follows Patryk everywhere, like a loyal code companion. Every stroll past the jeweler store leaves Patryk wondering why Ruby diamonds with 'on rails' aren't a thing yet.</p>

      <p>When not deciphering the secrets of coding languages, I can be found pumping iron at the gym or delving into self-development books. The current favorite? "49 Laws of Power," because even in coding, knowledge is power. I also find joy in slaying mythical beasts in God of War, binge-watching movies, and exploring the vast realm of socializing with friends.</p>

      <p>A recent transplant to London, I am on a quest to explore every nook and cranny of this city and has an insatiable wanderlust. Traveling is not just a hobby; it's a way of life for this coding explorer.</p>

      <p>Despite the rollercoaster ride that is being a Manchester United fan, I remain unwavering in support. The secret to retaining that youthful glow? Perhaps it's the constant optimism in the face of football adversity.</p>

      <p>In the fast-paced world of Formula 1, I cheer for Red Bull, hoping the energy drink can fuel the team to victory. As for Patryk's own energy, it seems to come from the sheer excitement of coding adventures.</p>

      <p>And now, a programmer's joke to tickle your debugging skills: Why do programmers prefer dark mode? Because light attracts bugs!</p>

      <p>In closing, I hopes that people enjoy the journey through this page as much as they enjoy debugging a flawless code. May your code compile swiftly, and your laughter be as infinite as an endless loop! ðŸš€</p>
